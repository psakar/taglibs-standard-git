 * Class representing an I18N localization context.

 *
 * <p> The resource bundle component is used by &lt;fmt:message&gt; for mapping
 * message keys to localized messages, and the locale component is used by the
 * &lt;fmt:message&gt;, &lt;fmt:formatNumber&gt;, &lt;fmt:parseNumber&gt;, &lt;fmt:formatDate&gt;,
 * and &lt;fmt:parseDate&gt; actions as their formatting or parsing locale, respectively.
