<h2>Release History</h2>

<dt><b>19 Apr 2002 </b></dt>
<dd>Standard 1.0 Beta2 released, which is compliant with the <a href="http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/first/jsr052/">JSTL Proposed Final Draft</a>.</dd>

<p><dt><b>12 Mar 2002 </b></dt>
<dd>Standard 1.0 Beta1 released, which is compliant with the <a href="http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/review/jsr052/">JSTL Public Review Draft</a>.</dd>

<p><dt><b>12 Dec 2001</b></dt>
<dd>Standard 1.0 EA3 released.  Version includes the following
changes and additions:
<ul>
 <li>Introduction of SQL tags ("sql:*" library).</li>
 <li>A performance improvement to the XML "transform" tag.</li>
 <li>Minor changes and bug fixes to the i18n and XML libraries.</li>
 <li>Distribution JAR files are now 'standard.jar' (RI) and 'jstl.jar'
     (API).</li>
 <li>showSource.jsp no longer depends on raw file I/O (and so 
     should work even when standard-examples is deployed as a WAR).</li> 
</ul>
</dd>

<dt><b>21 Nov 2001</b></dt>
<dd>Standard 1.0 EA2 introduced.  Version includes the following
major changes and additions:
<ul>
 <li>JSPTL has been renamed to JSTL.</li>
 <li>The "jsptl" library at Jakarta Taglibs has been renamed to
     "standard."</li>
 <li>Tags for text inclusion and URL encoding introduced.</li>
 <li>Tags for i18n-capable text formatting introduced.</li>
 <li>Tags for XML manipulation introduced.</li>
 <li>JSTL now divides functionality among multiple TLDs.  Each TLD represents
     a cohesive unit of functionality, such as "XML manipulation" and
     "formatting."  'jx' and 'jr' are no longer used; they are replaced
     with shorter abbreviations for the common cases (e.g., 'c', 'x').
 <li>ECMAScript is now the default expression evaluator.  Since the
     first release of 1.0 EA1, new languages include JXPath and ECMAScript.</li>
 <li>The RI has been thoroughly repackaged; many classes have moved.</li>
 <li>The package name for the JSTL API is now javax.servlet.jsp.jstl
     and is subdivided into cohesive packages.  (The old package for the
     API was javax.servlet.jsptl.)</li>
 <li>A small number of minor changes were made to the code.  By and large,
     these changes are not significant; the easiest way to discover
     further details is to look at the CVS archive itself.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Known Issues</h2>

<ol>
<li>Use of <tt>null</tt> with &lt;sql:param&gt; and &lt;sql:dateParam&gt;
<p> The Standard 1.0 taglib utilizes the
<tt>PreparedStatement.setObject(parameterIndex, null)</tt> when
specifying the &lt;sql:dateParam value="${null}" type='date'/&gt; or
&lt;sql:param value="${null}" /&gt; actions. Not all JDBC drivers currently
support the passing of <tt>null</tt> to the <tt>PreparedStatement.setObject()</tt>
method.  If you encounter a failure with your JDBC driver, please
execute a SQL DML statement which does not require &lt;sql:param&gt; or
&lt;sql:dateParam&gt; to specify a <tt>null</tt> value for a given column.
