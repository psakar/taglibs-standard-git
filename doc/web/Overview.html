<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>This document provides a high level overview of the JSP&#153; Standard Tag 
  Library (JSTL) as it stands for Beta 2. If you have a 
  strong opinion on the topic &#151; positive (you really like it), or constructive 
  (we messed up some parts and you have some constructive comments for improvements) 
  &#151; we'll be happy to hear from you at <a href="mailto:jsr-52-comments@jcp.org">jsr-52-comments@jcp.org</a>. 
  All comments will be read but we cannot guaranteee personal replies to all of 
  them. </p>
<p>Make sure you read this document first, then check out the jstl-examples web 
  application in the release (once you have installed it on your web container 
  following the instructions in the <a href="GettingStarted.html">Getting Started</a> 
  document). This will help you get a good feel for what JSTL is all about. Then 
  browse the other docs to get all the details, and finally give JSTL a ride in 
  your own <b>prototype</b> web application. You should use JSTL only in prototype 
  webapps because this is Early Access and things may/will change as we gather 
  feedback and make adjustments. Thanks for your help making JSTL an awesome standard 
  tag library...</p>
<h3>Design Philosophy</h3>
<p>JSP tag libraries help provide a clean separation between the business logic 
  and the presentation layer of web applications. By keeping the programming logic 
  out of JSP pages, web designers are now empowered to develop sophisticated JSP 
  pages without having to resort to the scripting language associated with their 
  JSP pages (usually the Java programming language). </p>
<p>The base design philosophy in JSTL is therefore to provide page authors with 
  a script free environment. EA1 defines the foundation elements to make this 
  possible.</p>
<h3>Multiple TLDs</h3>
<p>A Tag Library is a collection of actions that encapsulate functionality to 
  be used from within a JSP page. JSTL includes a wide variety of actions that 
  naturally fit into discrete functional areas. This is why JSTL, altough a single 
  standard tag library, is exposed via multiple TLDs to clearly show the functional 
  areas it covers, as well as to give each one of them their own namespace. The 
  table below lists these functional areas along with their URI. The table also 
  shows the prefixes used in our documentation and examples (although web applications 
  can use any prefix they want).</p>
<div align="center"> 
  <table border="1" cellpadding="5">
    <tr> 
      <th>Funtional Area</th>

    </tr>

<h3><br>
  Expression Language Support</h3>
<p>A key contribution of JSTL is the integration of an Expression Language (EL). 
  An EL leverages the fact that JSP scoped attributes are the privileged way to 
  communicate information from the business logic to the JSP pages. It makes it 
  possible to easily access application data and manipulate it in simple ways 
  without having to use scriptlets or request-time expression values. </p>
<p>For example, this conditional tag tests whether the country of a customer is 
  the USA.</p>
<p><code> &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;c:if test=&quot;${customer.address.country == 'USA'}&quot&gt;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...</code><br>
  <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/c:if&gt;</code></p>
<p>There were quite a few issues involved with the support of an Expression Language 
  within JSTL given the constraint that it had to work without requiring any change 
  to the JSP spec.&nbsp;In order to be able to support both the scripting (rtexprvalues) 
  and the EL (elexprvalues) worlds, we had to come up with the concept of twin 
  tag libraries: one that supports the expression language, and one that supports 
  request time expression values. Our assumption is that people will mostly use 
  the EL-based tag libraries, while it is still possible for hard core scripting 
  page authors to use JSTL with rtexprvalues (provides benefits for type safety 
  and performance) via the request-time based tag libraries (their URI simply 
  has the &quot;-rt&quot; suffix appended).</p>
<p>It is a hard task for the Expert Group to decide on a specific EL without first 
  getting the general feeling from the community. This is why JSTL currently 
  does not define a specific EL, but provides mechanisms for experimentation with 
  a variety of ELs. Tell us what you feel is important for that EL, and feel free 
  to implement one that others can experiment with. The goal is to select a single 
  EL once the JSTL spec is ready for Community Review.</p>
<p>Early Access contains several candidate Expression Languages. One of them is 
  an implementation subset of ECMAScript (JavaScript) and is the one used by default. 
  Please check <a href="EcmaScriptEL.html">EcmaScript as an Expression Language 
  for JSTL</a>.</p>
<h3>Tag Collaboration</h3>
<p>Tags usually collaborate with their environment in implicit and/or explicit 
  ways. Implicit collaboration is done via a well defined interface that allows 
  nested tags to work seamleasly with the ancestor tag exposing that interface. 
  The JSTL iterator tags support this mode of collaboration. Explicit collaboration 
  happens when a tag explicitely exposes information to its environment. Traditionally, 
  this has been done by exposing a scripting variable (with a JSP scoped attribute 
  providing the actual object). Because JSTL supports an expression language, 
  the need for scripting variables is significantly reduced. This is why all the 
  JSTL tags expose information only as JSP scoped attributes (no scripting variable 
  exposed). A bold move, we agree, but we feel this is the proper design decision 
  to support script-free JSP pages. </p>
<p>The convention is to use the name &quot;var&quot; for any tag attribute that 
  exports information about the tag. For example, an iterator tag exposes the 
  current item of the collection it is iterating over in the following way:</p>
<p><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;c:forEach var=&quot;customer&quot; items=&quot;${customers}&quot;&gt;</code><code><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...</code><br>
  <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/c:forEach&gt;</code></p>
<p>It is important to note that a name different than &quot;id&quot; was selected 
  to stress the fact that a variable is exposed (actually a JSP scoped attribute), 
  but not a scripting variable (which is normally the case when using an attribute 
  named &quot;id&quot;).</p>
<p>The convention also establishes the attribute &quot;scope&quot; to set the 
  scope (page, request, session, application) of the JSP scoped attribute.</p>
<p>In situations where a tag exposes more than one piece of information, the name 
  &quot;var&quot; is used for the primary piece of information being exported, 
  and an appropriate name is selected for any other secondary piece of information 
  exposed (e.g. an iteration current status information is exported by the foreach 
  tag via attribute <code>status</code>.)</p>
<p>The fact that JSTL tags do not expose scripting variables would make it hard 
  to collaborate with other tags whose data must be passed as rtexprvalues. To 
  that effect, tag &lt;declare&gt; allows to declare a scripting variable to be 
  associated with the JSP scoped attribute of the same name.</p>
<h3>Tag Overloading</h3>
<p>In JSTL, we try as much as possible to avoid too much &quot;overloading&quot; 
  of a tag; i.e. tags with lots of attributes that can do just about anything. 
  Rather, we privilege a larger number of tags with well focused behavior.</p>
